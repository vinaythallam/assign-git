1.)What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A.)The gitignore file is used to not track binary,intermediate and temporary files in a whole git repository.
In the java project, it used to ignore *.class to ignore all class files

2.)What does fast-forward in Git mean?
When there is a linear path from main to target branch instead of creating extra merge commits
it simply moves the main branch pointer to the target branch pointer.

3.)Why should you have different branches?
A.)Branches helps to work independently on modules without affecting the other modules and we can merge independently after
finished developing them.

4.)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A.)A project should  generally have one repository.
